# Generality of GHOST-v2

This repo will act as the definitive source of information for GHOST-v2. It will be updated as the project progresses. For multiple tasks, this repo checks if GHOST-v2 generalizes and if all components are necessary.

## File descriptions

* `defect-prediction`: Defect prediction ablation study
* `issue_close_time`: Issue lifetime prediction ablation study
* `smoothness-hpo`: A test to see if beta-smoothness can be used as a heuristic for HPO.
